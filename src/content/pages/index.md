        Hihi in Te reo Māori means rays of the sun. The sun symbolises light and growth, as does our Yoga practice. At Hihi Yoga we believe in creating strong foundations to grow our connection to our body and ourselves, in turn experiencing the lightness and focus the practice can offer our minds. 


        Practice with Becca in person or online.
